# Project Name

“A collection of classes following tutorials”

## 📌 About

This repository is purely a personal collection of classes I followed and built while learning from [**CodeBro**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_3CGp7cjH1pFfeFnJz3fDQ) on YouTube.  
It’s not meant to be revolutionary or production-ready—just a normal guy learning how to code, documenting my journey.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

- A set of files that correspond to tutorial videos.  
- Basic implementations, mostly for practice and reinforcement.  
- Minimal to no extra features beyond what the tutorial covers.

## ✅ Purpose

- Practice coding, reinforce concepts.  
- Build familiarity with object-oriented design (or whatever paradigm you're using).  
- Provide a reference for myself in future projects.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is **not** a polished library or framework.  
It’s simply my learning ground.  
Use it for inspiration or reference—but don’t expect production-grade quality.

## 🛠 Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

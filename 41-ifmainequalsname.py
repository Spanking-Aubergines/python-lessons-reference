# if __name__ == __main__: (this script can be imported or run standalone)
# Function and classes in this module can be reused without the main block of code executing
# Good practice ( code is modular
                    # helps readability,
                    # leaves no global variables,
                    # avoid unintened execution

                    # ex: library = impor library for functionality
                        # when running library directly, display a help page
